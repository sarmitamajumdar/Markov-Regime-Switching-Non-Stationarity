# Evaluating Non-Stationarity & Regime Switching in Climate Change Time Series Using Python

---

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to evaluate non-stationarity in global temperature anomaly data using statistical tests (ADF, KPSS), visualization, differencing techniques, and a Markov Regime Switching model.

Climate change time series often exhibit trends, variance shifts, and regime transitions—making them important real-world examples of non-stationary processes.
This repository provides full Python code to:

Load NASA GISTEMP global temperature anomaly dataset

Visualize long-term climate trends

Detect non-stationarity using ADF and KPSS tests

Transform the series into a stationary one

Fit a 2-regime Markov Switching model

Visualize and interpret climate regime transitions

This project can be used for learning, teaching, and research in time series analysis, climate data science, and applied statistics.
